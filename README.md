## ⚙️ Configuration

### Changing the Port

const PORT = 3000; // Change to your desired port
```

Common alternative ports: `3001`, `8080`, `8000`

### Changing File Size Limit

Edit `server.js` and modify the `limits.fileSize` in multer configuration:

```javascript
limits: {
  fileSize: 500 * 1024 * 1024 // 500MB - change as needed
}
```

### Changing Storage Directories

Modify the directory paths in `server.js`:

```javascript
const storeDir = path.join(__dirname, 'store');
const publicDir = path.join(__dirname, 'store', 'public');
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Port already in use
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

**Solution**: 
- Change the port in `server.js` to an available port
- Or stop the process using port 3000:
  ```bash
  # Find process using port 3000
  lsof -i :3000
  # Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
  kill -9 PID
  ```

---

### Can't Access from Other Devices

**Problem**: Other devices can't connect to the server

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Network**: Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network
2. **Check Firewall**: 
   - Windows: Allow Node.js through Windows Firewall
   - macOS: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall
   - Linux: Configure iptables or ufw
3. **Use Network IP**: Use the network IP shown in console, not `localhost`
4. **Check Router Settings**: Some routers block inter-device communication

---

### Files Not Uploading

**Problem**: Upload fails or times out

**Solutions**:
1. **Check File Size**: Ensure file is under the size limit (default 500MB)
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write permissions on `store/` directory
3. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient disk space available
4. **Check Network**: Verify stable network connection

---

### Files Not Appearing

**Problem**: Uploaded files don't show in the list

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh Page**: Manually refresh the browser
2. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
3. **Check Server Logs**: Look for errors in terminal
4. **Verify Storage**: Check if files exist in `store/` directory

---

### Slow Upload Speed

**Problem**: File uploads are slow

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Network**: Ensure strong WiFi signal
2. **Check Server Resources**: Ensure server has sufficient CPU/RAM
3. **Large Files**: Large files will take time; progress bar shows status
4. **Network Congestion**: Avoid heavy network usage during uploads

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Important Security Notes

⚠️ **This server is designed for local network use only. Do not expose it to the internet without proper security measures.**

### Security Recommendations

1. **Local Network Only**: Only run on trusted local networks
2. **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewall to restrict access
3. **File Validation**: Add file type validation if needed (modify server.js)
4. **Authentication**: Consider adding authentication for production use
5. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production (requires SSL certificate)
6. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. **File Scanning**: Scan uploaded files for malware if handling untrusted files

### Current Security Features

- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- File size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Input sanitization for file names
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
